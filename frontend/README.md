# 🚀 Token Explorer Frontend

## Getting Started

To setup the frontend, start by installing the dependencies.

```sh
npm i
```

Then, create a `.env` file with the env variables described in `.env.example`.

Finally, you can build and run the server using

```sh
npm run start
```

## Developping

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
